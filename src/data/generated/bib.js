        "abstract": "Spoofing is the act of masquerading as a valid user by falsifying data to gain an illegitimate access. Vulnerability of recognition systems to spoofing attacks (presentation attacks) is still an open security issue in biometrics domain and among all biometric traits, face is exposed to the most serious threat, since it is particularly easy to access and reproduce. In this paper, many different types of face spoofing attacks have been examined and various algorithms have been proposed to detect them. Mainly focusing on 2D attacks forged by displaying printed photos or replaying recorded videos on mobile devices, a significant portion of these studies ground their arguments on the flatness of the spoofing material in front of the sensor. However, with the advancements in 3D reconstruction and printing technologies, this assumption can no longer be maintained. In this paper, we aim to inspect the spoofing potential of subject-specific 3D facial masks for different recognition systems and address the detection problem of this more complex attack type. In order to assess the spoofing performance of 3D masks against 2D, 2.5D, and 3D face recognition and to analyze various texture-based countermeasures using both 2D and 2.5D data, a parallel study with comprehensive experiments is performed on two data sets: the Morpho database which is not publicly available and the newly distributed 3D mask attack database.",

        "abstract": "Automatic face recognition is now widely used in applications ranging from deduplication of identity to authentication of mobile payment. This popularity of face recognition has raised concerns about face spoof attacks (also known as biometric sensor presentation attacks), where a photo or video of an authorized person's face could be used to gain access to facilities or services. While a number of face spoof detection techniques have been proposed, their generalization ability has not been adequately addressed. We propose an efficient and rather robust face spoof detection algorithm based on image distortion analysis (IDA). Four different features (specular reflection, blurriness, chromatic moment, and color diversity) are extracted to form the IDA feature vector. An ensemble classifier, consisting of multiple SVM classifiers trained for different face spoof attacks (e.g., printed photo and replayed video), is used to distinguish between genuine (live) and spoof faces. The proposed approach is extended to multiframe face spoof detection in videos using a voting-based scheme. We also collect a face spoof database, MSU mobile face spoofing database (MSU MFSD), using two mobile devices (Google Nexus 5 and MacBook Air) with three types of spoof attacks (printed photo, replayed video with iPhone 5S, and replayed video with iPad Air). Experimental results on two public-domain face spoof databases (Idiap REPLAY-ATTACK and CASIA FASD), and the MSU MFSD database show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in spoof detection. Our results also highlight the difficulty in separating genuine and spoof faces, especially in cross-database and cross-device scenarios.",

Face anti-spoofing is a very critical step before feeding the face image to biometric systems. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stream CNN-based approach for face anti-spoofing, by extracting the local features and holistic depth maps from the face images. The local features facilitate CNN to discriminate the spoof patches independent of the spatial face areas. On the other hand, holistic depth map examine whether the input image has a face-like depth.

        "abstract": "Facial recognition is a popular biometric authentication technique, but it is rarely used in practice for device unlock or website/app login in smartphones, although most of them are equipped with a front-facing camera. Security issues (e.g. 2D media attack and virtual camera attack) and ease of use are two important factors that impede the prevalence of facial authentication in mobile devices. In this paper, we propose a new sensor-assisted facial authentication method to overcome these limitations. Our system uses motion and light sensors to defend against 2D media attacks and virtual camera attacks without the penalty of authentication speed. We conduct experiments to validate our method. Results show 95-97\\% detection rate and 2-3\\% false alarm rate over 450 trials in real-settings, indicating high security obtained by the scheme ten times faster than existing 3D facial authentications (3 seconds compared to 30 seconds).",

        "abstract": "Face authentication is one of promising biometrics-based user authentication mechanisms that have been widely available in this era of mobile computing. With built-in camera capability on smart phones, tablets, and laptops, face authentication provides an attractive alternative of legacy passwords for its memory-less authentication process. Although it has inherent vulnerability against spoofing attacks, it is generally considered sufficiently secure as an authentication factor for common access protection. However, this belief becomes questionable since image sharing has been popular in online social networks (OSNs). A huge number of personal images are shared every day and accessible to potential adversaries. This OSN-based facial disclosure (OSNFD) creates a significant threat against face authentication. In this paper, we make the first attempt to quantitatively measure the threat of OSNFD. We examine real-world face-authentication systems designed for both smartphones, tablets, and laptops. Interestingly, our results find that the percentage of vulnerable images that can used for spoofing attacks is moderate, but the percentage of vulnerable users that are subject to spoofing attacks is high. The difference between systems designed for smartphones/tablets and laptops is also significant. In our user study, the average percentage of vulnerable users is 64\\% for laptop-based systems, and 93\\% for smartphone/tablet-based systems. This evidence suggests that face authentication may not be suitable to use as an authentication factor, as its confidentiality has been significantly compromised due to OSNFD. In order to understand more detailed characteristics of OSNFD, we further develop a risk estimation tool based on logistic regression to extract key attributes affecting the success rate of spoofing attacks. The OSN users can use this tool to calculate risk scores for their shared images so as to increase their awareness of OSNFD.",

        "abstract": "Multimodal biometric systems are commonly believed to be more robust to spoofing attacks than unimodal systems, as they combine information coming from different biometric traits. Recent work has shown that multimodal systems can be misled by an impostor even by spoofing only one biometric trait. This result was obtained under a \u2018worst-case\u2019 scenario, by assuming that the distribution of fake scores is identical to that of genuine scores (i.e. the attacker is assumed to be able to perfectly replicate a genuine biometric trait). This assumption also allows one to evaluate the robustness of score fusion rules against spoofing attacks, and to design robust fusion rules, without the need of actually fabricating spoofing attacks. However, whether and to what extent the \u2018worst-case\u2019 scenario is representative of real spoofing attacks is still an open issue. In this study, we address this issue by an experimental investigation carried out on several data sets including real spoofing attacks, related to a multimodal verification system based on face and fingerprint biometrics. On the one hand, our results confirm that multimodal systems are vulnerable to attacks against a single biometric trait. On the other hand, they show that the \u2018worst-case\u2019 scenario can be too pessimistic. This can lead to two conservative choices, if the \u2018worst-case\u2019 assumption is used for designing a robust multimodal system. Therefore developing methods for evaluating the robustness of multimodal systems against spoofing attacks, and for designing robust ones, remain a very relevant open issue.",

        "abstract": "Effectively identifying attacked faces is an urgent problem to be solved in the scenario of face recognition. As deep learning is applied to face anti-spoofing (FAS), many multi-modal approaches have been proven to be more efficient than single-modal, but at the same time, multi-modal approaches require a huge number of parameters and therefore result in high computation. To tackle this problem, a lightweight network-based multi-modal FAS model was proposed, which took patch-level images from multi-modal images (YCbCr, Depth, and IR) as the input to different branches, and designed a lightweight feature extraction module to solve the redundancy of feature maps extracted by the filters. Finally, an attention-based feature fusion module was constructed to fuse and classify the features extracted by each branch network. A great number of comparative experimental results demonstrated that this method greatly reduced parameters at a high accuracy. For example, the accuracy on single-modal datasets (Replay-Attack and CASIA-FASD) is 100%, and that on multi-modal dataset (CASIA-SURF) is 98.1269% (TPR@FPR",
